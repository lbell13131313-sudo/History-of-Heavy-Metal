      <h2>Proto-Metal</h2>
      <p>Heavy Metal wasn't suddenly brought into existence with the sound it has today. Over the course of a few years the sound that would become Heavy Metal would be developed through the boundary pushing of Hard Rock, Psychodelic Rock, and Experimental bands at the time.</p>
      <section>
        <p>A few examples of highly influential songs for the development of Heavy Metal include:</p>
        <ul>
