        <h2>Heavy Metal in It's Infancy</h2>

        <section>
          <p>Now comes it's birth. Heavy Metal truly became it's own thing once 1970 hit. It's birth was celebrated with the release of Black Sabbath's self-titled debut album on February 13th, 1970. Having one of the most iconic track lists of any album from the 70s.</p>

          <p>This album is the culmination of the push for heavier sounds that had been going on in Rock for the past 2 years. The album is very bluesy, as is most evident with the track "The Wizard" where a harmonica is the driving instrument of the song. The track "Black Sabbath" is considered to be the first ever Doom Metal track, a genre that would later be popularized by trainblazers, Pentagram.</p>
          <!--Can't you tell how much I adore this album?-->
          <p>A lot of the album's sound was born from accidents as Geezer Butler, a guitarist, had been made the band's bassist. This lead Butler to follow along with the riffs done by guitarist and song writer Tony Iommi, which caused the album's riffs to sound much heavier. Iommi's unique playing style also contributed as he loosened his guitar strings to make it easier for him to play. He did this as at age 17, he lost the tips of his middle fingers on his fretting hand. Ozzy Osbourne's raspy voice only makes the album sound heavier as his vocals were something not really seen in the Hard Rock scene. The album is all wrapped in a bow thanks to Bill Ward's excellent drumming that compliments the rest of the album perfectly.</p>
